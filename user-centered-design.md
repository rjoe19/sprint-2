REFLECTIONS


2) In user-centered-design.md, answer the following:

i)Which principles seem most important to you?
- Reduce unnecessary mental effort by the user: whY? because I think the users interaction with the computer should be as simple, intuitive and effortless as possible...most people are IT illiterate and want something thats simple, clean and they don't want to feel like they have to read a big book of instructions to figure something out
- look at Apple products, they're userfriendly and require little mental effort to press icons and navigate around etc.



ii) Are there any with which you disagree or feel are unimportant or less important?
- to be honest they all seem really important and it makes sense to include them in User centered design....




iii) Are there any which surprised you?
- let the user drive: I guess when the program is built by someone else you'd think it would be mostly driven by them, but I guess it's got to be designed according to the users needs and way they want to navigate to be adopted.



3) Watch this five-minute video on the ROI of UCD, and answer the following in user-centered-design.md:

i) What surprised you?

-Just how important UCD regarding user engagement, drop off and resulting impact on financials of a business. The e.g. of the microlending website having poor UCD, leading to drop off in donations was startling and made me realise that UCD isn't just painting a pretty picture, but is an essential core element of increasing the ROI of running a platform online
- Also that it costs a lot more to fix issues post software release, then before and how important it is to rectifiy these before it hits the bottom line (i.e. re interaction w/ the end user!) - costs is 100x more after dev, then before!
-time spent on work that is avoidable is 50% of a dev's time!

ii) Does this change your view of web and software development?
yes - because you'd naturally think that the hardcore backend code is the really important stuff and the web design/UCD is a fluffly soft skill to make things just look pretty.
  ---->if the user has a poor experience, it'll increase the bounce rate and lead to poor outcomes at the end (however that goal is set by the dev, e..g conversions rates, opt-ins, clicking that buy botton etc...)
