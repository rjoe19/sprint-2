SCRUM REFLECTIONS


<NOTES>
Traditional Methods of software development:

1) Waterfall Model:
-isn't structured to accomodate continuous changes in requirements.
- Further, the user will not have clarity on the functionality of the product till the product becomes available in its entirety.

2) Iterative Incremental Model:
- In the iterative incremental model, the development starts with a limited number of finalized and prioritized requirements
- The outcome of the subsequent iteration is an enhanced working increment of the product. This is repeated till the product accomplishes the required functionalities.
- Any informal requirement changes during an iteration may lead to confusion and may also create scope creeps
------>hence need for Agile Development...


3) Agile Development:
- Agile development is based on iterative incremental development, in which requirements and solutions evolve through team collaboration
- It recommends a time-boxed iterative approach, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change

----->Scrum is a specific agile process framework that defines the practices required to be followed.


Agile Manifesto:
“We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work, we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan
That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more."

***** The key element of Agile Manifesto is that we must trust people and their ability to collaborate. For this reason, the specific agile methodologies developed tap the abilities of team members by emphasizing teamwork and collaboration throughout the life-cycle of the project. ******


Key Principles of Agile:
1) satisfaction and delivery
2) welcoming change
3) deliver frequently
4) commmunication is key
5) trust and environment
6) face to face commms
7) software as measure of progress
8) sustainable dev
9) attention to details
10) power of less
11) self organising teams


Agile Methodologies:
1) dynamic system dev methodology - used to fine tune trad. approaches

2) scrum: most popular framework; short iterations, quick and frequent deliveries.

3) Extreme Programming (XP)
- It is a type of agile software development. It advocates frequent releases in short development cycles, which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints where new customer requirements can be adopted


4) Test-driven Development (TDD)
- It is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle

5) Lean:
It is a production practice that considers the expenditure of resources for any goal other than the creation of value for the end-customer to be wasteful, and thus a target for elimination


6) Kanban:
It is a system to improve and keep up a high level of production. Kanban is one method through which Just-In-Time (JIT), the strategy the organizations employ to control the inventory expenses, is achieved


SCRUM
The Scrum Team consists of three roles, namely a ScrumMaster, a Product Owner, and the Team.

1) ScrumMaster:
The ScrumMaster (sometimes written as the Scrum Master, although the official term has no space after “Scrum”) is the keeper of the scrum process


2) Product Owner: The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Team

The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog

3) The Team
The Team is self-organizing and cross-functional. That means the team comprises of analysts, designers, developers, testers, etc. as appropriate and as relevant to the projec





Scrum Process Framework can be viewed by means of a sequence of events and the corresponding artifacts:

The vital events of scrum are-

-1) The Sprint
-During a Sprint, a working product Increment is developed. It is usually of duration two weeks or one month, and this duration remains constant for all the sprints in the project. 



2) Sprint Planning
-The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned in the Sprint Planning Meeting.
-Sprint Planning Meeting is of duration of maximum of four hours for two weeks sprints and eight hours for one month Sprints

3) Daily Scrum Meetings
-The Daily Scrum Meeting is a 15-minute meeting for the Team, conducted daily to quickly understand the work since the last Daily Scrum Meeting and create a plan for the next 24 hours.

4)The Sprint Review
- A Sprint Review is held at the end of every Sprint. During the Sprint Review, a presentation of the increment that is getting released is reviewed


5) The Sprint Retrospective
- The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning. 
-The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to introspect and improve within the Scrum process framework so as to make the next Sprint outcome more effective.













1) What interests you?

- being able to work on projects rapidly, with have short iteration cycles and constant updating with the end user 
- ability to make changes rapidly during the dev as opposed to the trad. model.
- increased collaboration within teams, possibly increased/improved communication?
- user focused, i.e. a focus on customer value.



2) What confuses you?

-how often is communication with the end user involved?
- what are weaknesses with agile? with scrum? and how are these being addressed or modified upon?
-agile all sounds well and good but how do we go about actually implementing it?
- what happens when things go pear shaped during a scrum sprint or iteration?
