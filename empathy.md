Log your reflections on:
- give an example of a time in your life where you've shown empathy for another.

- Not long ago I had a friend who had some health issues and was going through signs of mild clinical depression.  I was living out of town and we had a few skype talks, he felt like opening up to me as I've experienced brief depression before.  I let him talk things through, his experiences and didn't judge him for feeling down.

Was it difficult?
  - No.  I'm naturally drawn to counsel people in need and show empathy, especially if they're feeling sad or in a negative state.

Was it worth it? Why or why not?
- yes definitely.  I think letting someone know that you've experienced what they have allows them to realise that they aren't the only one whos gone through a life issue.  If you show empathy without being judgemental, it helps that person to recover much quicker then if they were left to their own devices
