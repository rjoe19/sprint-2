Log your reflections on:



1) What social capital is?

- social capital: mutual reliance, an underlying sense of connectedness that builds trust
    - By creating mutual trust with each other it is thought that a company can break down barriers and work towards its goal more effectively.



2) How important do you think trust and empathy are to your success in life?
- After reading this article I realise how important it is to develop social connections and trust with each other both within a professional context as well as personal.  I know that IQ alone is not enough, and has been too highly emphasised as a predictor of success.  But we're social creatures and are made for interacting with one another, sharing ideas and in saying that empathy is crucial to being able to understand another person's perspective on something.
