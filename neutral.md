Log your reflections on:

1) What do you think?
- First of all this is a very touchy subject to comment on and it's something that we as society would need to continually 

- I think society has moved a long way towards equality between the sexes and I realise that a lot of the language that still exists in society today is as a result of a time when the world was predominantly male dominated and hence filtered into the everyday language that people used.

I have realised that it's imperative to consider other people's feelings and perspectives in regards to language usage.  At the same time I think it depends on the context.  If Im in a formal environment such as a work setting or visiting a client then I'll be careful to adhere to gender-neutral language.  On the other hand, when I'm with people that are close to me and I know I can act casual with them and wouldn't be offended, then I can let my hair down and not adhere to it so much and say things such as "hey guys" etc...





2) Do you make an effort to use gender neutral language?
Yes - predominantly in formal situations such as in the workforce or meeting people for the first time, as I realise first impressions are important.



What do you think when you hear non-gender-neutral language?
- I think of the need to understand and recognise the importance of gender equality in society, but also consider people's feelings regarding how they prefer to be addressed.
