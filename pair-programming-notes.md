PAIR PROGRAMMING THOUGHTS

HTML/JAVASCRIPT

Pick a classmate and try doing some pair programming on your HTML or JS this week. Record your observations and thoughts in a document called pair-programming-notes.md in your repo. (15 minutes for documentation)



I paired up with Howard and we decided to use the classic navigator-driver pairing method and apply that to the JS tasks on Freecodecamp (starting from after #45 and above).  I decided to drive first and let him navigate.  

- I was totally stumped on a problem for at least 30 mins.  It was to do with a reduce method array.  I couldn't get my head around the concept examples shown.  As he had a better understanding then me, he was in a way driving the task more then me in a sense, going through documentation on MDN and writing basic examples on paper.  Because I was totally stumped, I couldn't type any code at all initially, then after letting explanations sink in I 'clicked' and was able to complete the task successfully.

- From this experience, we both learnt that the pairing experience is best initiated when both people have a similar skill level, as both are on the same parr and can relate to each others skill level/problem solving ability.  In saying that, I think better flow can be achieved.
        -if on the other hand, if one's skill level far exceeds another, then in the case of the navigator being much higher then the driver, he/she could tend to take over 'driving' and perhaps both can get a bit frustrated in the process.


  - Another thing we learnt was regarding learning style and personality.  Our preferred learning styles were predominantly visual + kinaesthetic, so we gelled quite well in the regard.  We also tend to both have both chilled out, casual personalities so there wasn't really any clash there.  I think this is where the emotional empathy section of our learning becomes vital to apply and made me really value why this is being taught at EDA, beyond just the techical skills.

  - When it came to Howard's turn to drive, we we're doing basic JS object orientated tasks and it was much easier for me to navigate and be on parr with him.  Hence, referring again to the above what I mentioned on both navigator + driver being on the same page skill wise.

  - Going forward, I think it's also important to get ask each other how they feel with a language, how they're feeling in general to understand their mental/emotional state, and of couse to establish a good level of rapport, trust and respect with each other.
